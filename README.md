# ðŸ‘‹ About

Hey! 

I'm Mickey, and I'm deeply devoted to telling the stories I find within data. 

> ### ðŸ”­ Data analysts are explorers, detectives, and artists, and I am both passionate and curious about the role we play in today's businesses. 

By combining data visualization and organic, holistic support, I provide high-level support to women-owned and minority-owned small businesses by helping them make data-driven decisions towards their goals.
